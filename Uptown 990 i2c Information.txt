21 byte message is written to driver boards
20 byte message is read from driver boards
Micro controller used is a Teensy-LC: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyLC.html
My system only has Automated Faders and Mutes if you have more on yours everything I've written may not work completely
Must have Teensyduino installed for this code to work: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html
This has only been tested on MacOS, but there shouldn't be problems for Windows

I only designed it to communicate with one driver board but you could extend it for all of them, but a faster micro controller would probably be needed, I just wanted to keep the 
usb midi simple and just have one per 8 channels similar to real Mackie HUI/MCU mixers

I did not implement the entirety of the systest program only enough for initial tests and the rest of my code is just to communicate HUI/MCU to the driver boards
My code communicates HUI and MCU at the same time so there is no option to choose either one or switch them as they run at the same time, from my tests it doesn't seem to cause any 
lag by communicating them both at the same time, just don't try to use them both in a DAW, pick one or the other when you setup the device

In order to read information from the driver boards you have to write to the board first and wait 30ms before you can read the updated information and you repeat as fast as you can
Any less than 30ms after writing and there's not enough delay for all the channels to update on the driver board.

The i2c address of all the driver boards appears to be 0x40, but it could be different as it seems you are able to change it based on the systest.exe program
To change the mode of the driver board you send the mode as a two byte message EX: 0x40 0x80 0x80

Fader is a 10 bit number 
This is what is written to the driver boards for position

Channel numbers might be backwards but this is how it was send and read from my boards, as 8-1 instead of 1-8

Byte 1		0x60	0x80	0x90	0x33	0x64	0x60	0xB0				Seems to only write faders on 0x80 and 0x90
Byte 2		0x60	0x80?	0x90?		0x64						0x80 seems to move fader and not stop if it's touched after it starts moving
		0x08	0x08	0x08		0x08	0x08 	0x08				0x90 seems to be the run time number
												0xB0 seems to be sent when you close the program and for button/led test
												Other values don't appear to have an effect, but I haven't tested them extensively
												0x60 doesn't update board and only seems to read them
